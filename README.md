# Portfolio
Short programs I wrote in Python to showcase what I'm learning

## DnD Dice
A small program to roll dice for a DnD-style tabletop rpg

## Computer Guessing Game
The user chooses a number between 1 and 100, and the computer guesses it and returns the number of tries it took.

## RPG Character Creation
It allows the user to create a RPG character and assign points to four attributes, Strength, Health, Wisdom, and Dexterity. The user can check the currents stats and available points, and add and remove points from the various attributes. 

## Games of Chance
An app that allows the user to bet on four different mini-games: flipping a coin, Ch≈ç-Han, drawing cards, and a simplified roulette.
